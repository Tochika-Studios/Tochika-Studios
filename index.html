    I was one of the orphans. Until they took me to a place high above the clouds and performed experiments on me. I wasn't the only one; I saw many others being used in cruel experiments. Those who survived had their brains washed. When they were finally going to brainwash me, they changed their minds and just sent me to the world of my own mind. I became a spectator of my own life. I no longer had control of my own body. Another personality controlled it. And I could only watch. But I found a weakness, a weakness that could free not only me, but all the other orphans who had their minds overwritten. Somehow, electrical energy causes the minds to return to normal. With the right amount, I will be able to go back to who I was.
